                                Porter Robinson - is an American DJ, record producer, musician, and singer from Chapel
                                Hill, North Carolina. His debut full-length studio album, Worlds, was released in 2014
                                and peaked at #1 on Billboard’s Top Dance/Electronic Albums. Robinson began releasing
                                music under the alias Virtual Self in 2017, with his self-titled EP Virtual Self
                                debuting the same year.

                                Robinson was nominated for the 2019 Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording for his single

                                and the Shelter Live Tour, respectively.

                                In 2011, he signed a one-EP deal with OWSLA, then a new label operated by Skrillex, to
                                release the eleven-track Spitfire. As the first release on OWSLA, it topped iTunes Dance
                                chart and Beatport's overall chart, crashing the latter's servers upon release.

                                Robinson released a single, "Language", on April 10, 2012 through Big Beat Records in
                                North America, and Ministry of Sound everywhere else. The song was relatively different
                                in its production than the "complextro" sound that Robinson had become known for,
                                favoring a more melodic sound and a dream-like piano lead. The song rose to the number
                                one overall chart position on Beatport as well as the iTunes Dance chart. The single was
                                premiered initially via a live BBC Radio 1 Essential Mix on January 27. The music video,
                                directed by Jodeb, was released via Ministry of Sound's YouTube channel on August 1,
                                2012. The song was also included as the menu music for the 2012 video game Forza
                                Horizon. Throughout the rest of 2012, Robinson embarked on his "Language Tour",
                                supported by artists Mat Zo and The M Machine.

                                During Robinson's "Language Tour", he continually began to grow tired of the current
                                dance music scene, centered around formulaic songs with timed builds and beat drops,
                                designed to excite people at festivals and clubs. Robinson stated, “The more I forced
                                myself to work within those DJ-friendly limits, the more I resented the genre.” He then
                                spent the next year or so working on a new album and live show, of which he stated,
                                "...when I do change the style of my show into the live thing I'm going to do later this
                                year, I want the shift in focus to be clear."

                                Porter's debut studio album Worlds was released through Astralwerks and Virgin EMI on
                                August 12, 2014. The album focused more on melodies to invoke a sense of nostalgia,
                                juxtaposing the percussive bass driven tracks he had released previously. Robinson
                                collaborated with multiple vocalists and musical groups including Urban Cone, Lemaitre,
                                Breanne Düren, and Amy Millan. He made his official vocal debut on the single "Sad
                                Machine". The Vocaloid software voice, Avanna, was also used as a vocalist for this
                                single. Robinson then embarked on the Worlds tour, a new live show that involved him
                                singing, playing synthesizers, and triggering samples, supported by artists Giraffage
                                and Lemaitre. The tour headlined popular music festivals, including Ultra Music
                                Festival, Electric Daisy Carnival, and Coachella.

                                Virtual Self, announced via his Twitter page. A music video was also released on
                                Robinson's YouTube channel, containing abstract three-dimensional art and cryptic
                                messages seemingly focusing on the words "angel", "virtual", "void", and "utopia".

                                Virtual Self held a debut live performance on December 8, 2017 in Brooklyn, New York
                                City. Virtual Self shows continued in 2018, with appearances at multiple festivals
                                including Ultra Music Festival, Electric Daisy Carnival, and Bonnaroo, followed by three
                                Europe shows[49] and a two-month North American "UTOPiA SySTEM" tour. Robinson also
                                released Angel Voices on July 20, 2018, a happy-hardcore infused remix of Ghost Voices.

                                In January 2019, it was announced that Ghost Voices was nominated for a Grammy Award for
                                Best Dance Recording, marking Robinson's first nomination. Robinson celebrated the
                                accomplishment by playing three Virtual Self sets in Los Angeles before the awards
                                ceremony. In a statement to Billboard Dance, Robinson says he discovered the nomination
                                through Twitter of all places. At the time, he hadn't even realized "Ghost Voices" was
                                submitted for consideration. "I was ecstatic, to be honest...I basically found out from
                                Twitter...I just never once considered it as a real possibility at all...something about
                                how vastly it exceeded my expectations," he said. And he added "It was really
                                gratifying."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On March 4, 2019, Robinson announced Multiverse Music Festival, a one-day festival in
                                Oakland, California featuring a self-curated lineup and co-presented by Goldenvoice,
                                slated for June 15 in Middle Harbor Shoreline Park. The name of the festival was changed
                                to Second Sky Music Festival four days later due to complaints from local promoters that
                                had organized a fest in Oakland with a similar name the previous year. A second day was
                                added during presale due to tickets for the original date selling out rapidly, sharing
                                all but one act from the first day's lineup. Robinson stated in an interview with
                                Pollstar that "The main reason I wanted to do an artist-curated festival is I have this
                                fantasy of there being a place where all of my favorite music can coexist."
